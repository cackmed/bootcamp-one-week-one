        Over the course of my life, my family has had 8 dogs, and two cats. The dogs were Casey, Ozlo, Copper, Bailey, Tiny, Smoke, and elvis adopted in that order. 
        While we adopted our two cats Snoopy and Monkey as babies, so we had them during the lifetimes of several of our families dogs. At this point though, my family is down to only two dogs, and a cat that has recently decided to move in with my Mother.

        all of them have had Amazon as the primary market place, with the first two companies never having sold off of it.
